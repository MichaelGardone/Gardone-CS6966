{"input": "scene: the desert description: Two men with tattered clothing are stranded on the desert next to a skull. One of the men is happy and is staring at his watch, while the other man is distraught. uncanny: It is strange for someone to be so happy when they're dying and suffering in the desert. The watch may be very precious is the man is giving it so much attention when his basic needs are at such a low. entities: Watch, Mirage, Starvation. caption: Maybe this thing isn't a compass.", "target": "The two stranded people are lost in the desert: the suggestion is that they didn't realize that a watch (which has rotating hands, causing them to go in circles endlessly) wasn't a compass (which points consistently). Watches and compasses look similar physically, so it's humorous to think that someone could mistake the two.", "instance_id": "c4e0077d231de401ece98bb63f322dad", "caption_choices": "Maybe this thing isn't a compass.", "generated_idefics": " This cartoon is amusing because it depicts a conversation between two cavemen, with one of them holding a rock and the other one asking, \"Hey, do you want to see something funny?\" The first caveman then proceeds to crack a joke, and the second one laughs. The humor comes from the juxtaposition of the primitive setting and the modern concept of telling jokes."}
{"input": "scene: a hospital description: A person is getting an MRI scan. The top half of his body is in a room with a priest and the second half of his body is in a normal hospital room. uncanny: When receiving an MRI your body goes through an enclosed tube and you are not seen by a priest. entities: Magnetic_resonance_imaging, Confessional. caption: Your sins are forgiven, but not your co-pay.", "target": "Catholic confessionals involve priests listening and forgiving the sins of churchgoers --- in this case, the confessional is an MRI machine, which costs a lot of money to use. The play on words is: the persons sins are forgiven by the priest, but the priest cant \"forgive\" (i.e., cancel) the copay medical cost.", "instance_id": "7061cfc3afb444fbbd2e74ba73cfb9eb", "caption_choices": "Your sins are forgiven, but not your co-pay.", "generated_idefics": " The image is humorous because it depicts a man in a scanner, which is a common scene in cartoons and comics where the subject is placed in a machine to visualize their internal organs. However, in this case, the man is not in a scanner but is actually lying on a bed in a doctor's office. The juxtaposition of the two scenarios creates a comical and unexpected situation."}

They can see the ribs lining the walls and ceiling. uncanny: There are two chefs inside a giant beast. entities: Chef, Whale. caption: Not the return to inside dining I was expecting.", "target": "A joke about the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, people weren't allowed to eat inside restaurants because the virus spread through the air. When restrictions lifted, there was a return to indoor dining. But these folks have returned to inside a whale's stomach, which is an unexpected and absurd way of returning indoors.", "instance_id": "f65170c5a269f77d5994828442e6036c", "caption_choices": "Not the return to inside dining I was expecting.", "generated_idefics": " The image shows two chefs in a tunnel, holding umbrellas. The unusual combination of the chefs and the umbrellas, which are typically used for protection against rain, can be seen as humorous. It's not a common sight to associate chefs with umbrellas, so the image creates a lighthearted and amusing scene."}
{"input": "scene: the mountains description: Two hikers are high up on a mountain. It is one man and one woman and they are having a conversation. A yeti, or bigfoot, is behind them making his way slowly up the mountain but they don't seem to notice it. uncanny: A yeti can be seen making its way up the mountain and this is a creature that likely doesn't actually exist. entities: Bigfoot, Sunglasses, Hiking. caption: Oh, shit! What if your sister-in-law is also right about God?", "target": "One of the hiker's sister in law believed in bigfoot, which turned out to be correct --- the hikers spotted the mythical creature. But, the sister also believes in god --- so this occurrence has made both hikers question whether or not god is real too.", "instance_id": "2af86807d57cf3abe5fd2403649f8424", "caption_choices": "Oh, shit! What if your sister-in-law is also right about God?", "generated_idefics": " The image shows three people on a mountain, with one person in a gorilla suit. The gorilla suit is a humorous element that adds an unexpected and entertaining twist to the scene. People might find this funny because it's unusual to see someone wearing a gorilla suit while hiking, and it creates a lighthearted and amusing moment."}

One of the fish is just bones. uncanny: The fish on the left should be dead since it's only bones. entities: Fish, Bone. caption: It’s mostly water weight.", "target": "\"Water weight\" is often a reason people cite for being overweight.   But here, the fish skeleton is extremely skinny, so it's a weird but topically fitting thing to say about its weight because they are underwater.", "instance_id": "bb31f09ad089bec8e385062f1577a9e6", "caption_choices": "It’s mostly water weight.", "generated_idefics": " This drawing is amusing because it features a variety of animals, such as fish and a dog, swimming together in a black and white drawing. The combination of different species in the same scene is unexpected and humorous. Additionally, the fact that the drawing is in black and white adds to the quirky and funny nature of the scene."}
