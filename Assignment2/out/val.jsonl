The skeleton has a top hat and cane. uncanny: The costume is not part of the dino skeleton. entities: Fossil, Dance. caption: This particular species is believed to have travelled in troupes.", "target": "The word \"troupes\" sounds like the word \"groups\" --- biologists will often speculate as to whether or not extinct species \"traveled in groups\" based on fossil records. But here, because the dinosaurs are dancing together, they are travelling in a \"dancing troupe\", which is funny.", "instance_id": "8cf73e8fb6b547ec693868c7f5a85f36", "caption_choices": "This particular species is believed to have travelled in troupes.", "generated_idefics": " This image is a clever play on the concept of dinosaurs and their extinction. The two skeletons of dinosaurs are depicted dancing, which is an unusual and unexpected scene. The fact that they are dancing in a museum setting adds to the humor, as it is an unusual context for such an activity. The sign in the image says \"Dinosaurs,\" which further emphasizes the theme of dinosaurs and their extinction. The fact that the dinosaurs are dancing on top of skulls adds an element of irony, as it is a lighthearted scene in a setting that is typically associated with death and decay.", "generated_llama2": " This set of images and captions is funny to people for several reasons:\n1. Unexpected juxtaposition: The combination of a serious and formal setting (a museum) with a ridiculous and absurd element (a top hat and cane on a dinosaur skeleton) creates an unexpected juxtaposition that catches the viewer's attention and creates humor.\n2. Play on expectations: The caption \"This particular species is believed to have traveled in troupes\" subverts the viewer's expectations of what they might see in a museum. They are expecting to see a realistic depiction of a dinosaur skeleton, but instead get a humorous and unexpected twist.\n3. Wordplay: The use of the word \"troupe\" is a clever play on words, as it can refer to both a group of performers and a type of dinosaur. This wordplay adds an extra layer of humor to the image.\n4. Visual irony: The image of a dinosaur skeleton wearing a top hat and cane is a visual irony, as it is an unlikely and absurd scenario. The skeleton is not supposed to be wearing clothing or accessories, and the idea of a dinosaur in a suit is inherently funny.\n5. Surrealism: The image is surreal and absurd, which can create a sense of unease or disorientation in the viewer. This can be a source of humor, as it challenges the viewer's expectations and creates a sense of surprise.\n\nOverall, the combination of unexpected juxtaposition, play on expectations, wordplay, visual irony, and surrealism in this set of images and captions creates humor and catches the viewer's attention."}

The unusual and unexpected presence of a rhinoceros in a living room setting creates a comical and surreal scene. The man's surprised expression adds to the humor, as it implies that he wasn't expecting the rhinoceros to be there.", "generated_llama2": " This set of images and captions is funny to people for several reasons:\n1. Unexpected juxtaposition: The images depict unexpected and absurd situations, such as a hippo in a living room or a business meeting in a slanted room. This unexpectedness creates a sense of surprise and humor.\n2. Wordplay: The captions use wordplay to create a humorous effect. For example, in the first image, the caption \"Welcome to orientation\" is a play on words, as it could refer to both the company orientation and the physical orientation of the tilted room.\n3. Social commentary: The images and captions touch on various social issues, such as the absurdity of modern work culture (in the first image) and the challenges of marriage (in the second image). This social commentary adds an extra layer of humor to the set.\n4. Visual humor: The images themselves are visually humorous, with the hippo in the living room being a particularly striking and unexpected sight. The use of exaggerated facial expressions and body language in the images also adds to the humor.\n\nOverall, the set of images and captions is funny because it uses a combination of unexpected juxtapositions, wordplay, social commentary, and visual humor to create a humorous effect."}

Unlikely scenario: The idea of a train being anthropomorphic and sitting at a bar, drinking beer, is an unlikely scenario that creates a sense of absurdity. People find it amusing because it's something they wouldn't expect to see in real life.\n2. Exaggeration: The train's sadness and crying are exaggerated, making it even more humorous. The idea of a train, which is typically associated with movement and speed, being unable to cope with its emotions is a comical concept.\n3. Wordplay: The captions play on words, using puns and double meanings to add to the humor. For example, \"We uncoupled\" is a pun on the idea of trains being coupled together, but also a reference to the train's emotional state.\n4. Surrealism: The images are surreal, creating a dreamlike atmosphere that challenges the viewer's expectations. The juxtaposition of a train, which is typically associated with movement and progress, in a bar, drinking a beer, is a surrealistic image that creates a sense of unease and humor.\n5. Cultural references: The image of a train crying and drinking beer may also be seen as a reference to the idea of \"train therapy,\" where people use trains as a metaphor for emotional healing. This adds an extra layer of humor to the image.\n\nOverall, the combination of an unlikely scenario, exaggeration, wordplay, surrealism, and cultural references create a humorous effect that makes this set"}

Here, the cake was ordered, but the payment didn't go through, so instead of delivering the positive message, the person jumping out of the cake delivers the far more underwhelming message that the cake still needs to be paid for.

Unexpected twist: In each image, there is an unexpected twist or reversal of expectations. For example, in the first image, a minotaur is in a bar instead of being in a maze, and in the second image, a woman comes out of a cake instead of a man. This unexpected twist creates humor.\n2. Play on words: The captions are cleverly worded, playing on the meanings of the words \"orientation\" and \"re-oriented.\" This wordplay adds to the humor.\n3. Social norms: The images and captions subvert or challenge social norms. For example, in the second image, the woman is surprised to see a man come out of a cake instead of the other way around. This reversal of expectations is humorous.\n4. Visual irony: In the third image, the man coming out of the cake is a visual irony, as it is not what one would expect to happen in a dating situation. This visual irony adds to the humor.\n5. Absurdity: The images and captions are absurd and illogical, which can be amusing to people. The absurdity of the situations creates a sense of surprise and unexpectedness, which can be humorous.\n\nOverall, the humor in this set of images and captions comes from the unexpected twists, wordplay, subversion of social norms, visual irony, and absurdity."}

Unexpected twist: The first two images show a normal business meeting and a person with a leash, but the third image reveals that the leash is actually for a dog, which is not what the caption suggests. This unexpected twist creates humor.\n2. Wordplay: The caption for the second image \"Relax, she prefers dachshunds\" is a play on words as \"she\" refers to the dog, but also sounds like \"snake\". This clever use of language adds to the humor.\n3. Visual irony: In the third image, the man's leash is empty, which is the opposite of what the caption suggests. This visual irony adds to the humor.\n4. Everyday situations: The scenarios depicted in the images are common everyday situations, making them relatable and familiar to the viewer. This familiarity makes the humor more accessible and enjoyable.\n5. Clever use of language: The captions use clever language and wordplay, which adds to the humor. The use of puns and double meanings creates a sense of surprise and delight, making the images more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, the combination of unexpected twists, clever language, visual irony, relatable scenarios, and everyday situations make this set of images and captions funny to people."}
