In practice this means that the fast version of the tokenizer can produce unknown tokens whereas the sentencepiece version would have converted these unknown tokens into a sequence of byte tokens matching the original piece of text.

Some weights of DebertaV2ForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/deberta-v3-base and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'pooler.dense.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pooler.dense.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
